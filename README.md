Implementation Explanations

Usability:
My website is very user friendly. There are no surprises or anything that would confuse a user. There is a homepage that has a sidebar and that sidebar takes you to different pages that explain more of the irrespective sidebar selection. The interactive search aspect of my website has clear instructions and is user friendly.


Educational Value:
My website has four useful educational pages. It has “About” which gives information about what automation is so the user can get a deeper understanding of what it is and isn't. There are “benefits” and “drawbacks” pages that describe the positives and negatives. This is informative to any user that has a narrow mind of automation. I had two personas that would use this effectively. My college student who is aware of the positives but wants to know more and my recently unemployed persona who doesn't know any of the positives and is annoyed with automation. This section will help to educate both the good and bad sides of automation. The last section is “History” and this is informative about how automation has been successfully implemented in the past which helps users get some perspective.


Interactivity:
My interactivity aspect is the search portion of my website.This is the largest part of my website and the most important. This is where I made a database of over 700 industries and occupations for users to search through and see how likely they are to be automated. This is where both my persona of a new college graduate and my recently unemployed persona can search for different jobs that interest them and see how likely they are to be automated so they can better make a decision.


Aesthetics:
My website is basic, but it's clean and effective for what my users will be looking for. There's nothing too special about it but I think its aesthetic personally as I am a minimalist. This would be a much bigger aspect of my website in the future however I used most of my little time to complete the website on research and making my database.


Special Effort:
For my interactive section of my website, I made a database manually with nothing but the information. I had to add each of the 702 industries into the database as there was no easy way to convert the information to make it searchable. This is where most of my time was spent as I believe this is the most important aspect of this topic. To see the database, go into my “Search.html” file in my repository and it is locally stored there. 

I believe I deserve an A on this project because I put in a lot of effort to make a good website that can be used outside of this class and inform many different people on Automation in different Industries.
