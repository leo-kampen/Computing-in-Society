		<h2 id="History">History</h2>
		<p>The history of automation is long and complex, but to make it simple, automation has had some impact on any given industry at some point. Some examples are the invention of the automobile. This put out many jobs of horse and biggie operators, but I think we can all agree that that had an overall positive effect on history. Another example where people fought back against automation is back in 1589, 

In the more recent years from 1980 to today, computerization has taken a lead role in automation. The innovation of the computer has put out of work several hundreds of thousands of industries like bookkeepers, auditing clerks, and secretaries. But it has also created over 19 million jobs for industries like computer science, software engineering, online retail shopping and much more.
